SHORT ANSWER

1. Why do programmers use pseudocode? Pseudocode helps programmers brainstorm on projects and helps them develop algorithyms. 

2. If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?
Pseudocode is not a programming language.  It can not run or compile it.

PROGRAMMING ASSIGNMENT

1. Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.
FUNCTION addNumber(Num1, Num2)
   IF num1 is greater than Num2
      PRINT "Num1 is the greater number"
   ELSE
      PRINT "Num2 is the greater number"
   END IF
END FUNCTION

2. Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.
FUNCTION printNumber
   INIT Number to 1
   WHILE the Number is less then and equal to 100
      PRINT Number
      ADD Number to 1
   END WHILE
END FUNCTION

3. Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.
FUNCTION searchPhonebook(Entry, PhoneBookArray)
   SEARCH PhoneBookArray for Entry
   STORE results in Results

   IF Results equals 0
      PRINT "No search results found"
      ELSE
         PRINT "Search results found for: " Entry
   END IF
END FUNCTION

4. Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.


ONE
function addNumber(num1, num2){
   if (num1 >= num2){
      console.log(num1 + " is the greater number.");
   } else {
      console.log(num2 + " is the greater number.");
   }
}
addNumber(4,5);


TWO
function printNumber(){
   var number = 1;
   while (number <= 100){
      console.log(number);
      number += 1;
   }
}
printNumber();


THREE
function searchPhoneBook(entry, phoneBookArray){
   var results = phoneBookArray.filter(item => item == entry);
  
   if (results.length === 0){
      console.log('No search results found.');
   } else {
      console.log('Search found for: ' + entry);
   }
}
searchPhoneBook('todd',['jim', 'joe', 'todd']);
